# Exploring Performance-Driven and Cost-Efficient Convergence Solutions for Cloud and HPC

This repository contains scripts and data for conducting benchmarking and visualization of performance metrics. Below is an overview of the repository structure and its contents:

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks directory contains 90 workflow files used in COSBench testing. These workflows are configured to simulate different workload scenarios on various storage systems.

## Figures

The figures directory contains .drawio files used to create graphical elements for visualizing research findings. 

## Py-Scripts

The py-scripts directory houses Python scripts designed for data visualization and analysis. These scripts utilize libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process benchmark data, generate plots, and visualize performance metrics across different storage systems.
